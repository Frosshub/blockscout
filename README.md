Blockscout allows users to search transactions, view accounts and balances, verify and interact with smart contracts and view and interact with applications on the Ethereum network including many forks, sidechains, L2s and testnets.

Blockscout is an open-source alternative to centralized, closed source block explorers such as Etherscan, Etherchain and others. As Ethereum sidechains and L2s continue to proliferate in both private and public settings, transparent, open-source tools are needed to analyze and validate all transactions.

Supported Projects
Blockscout currently supports several hundred chains and rollups throughout the greater blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot, Avalanche, Near and many others include Blockscout integrations. A comprehensive list is available at chainsblockscout.com. If your project is not listed, contact the team in Discord.
